# Project Chrysanthemum: Japan-China AI Integration 2015-2025

Between 2015 and 2025, Japan-China joint AI patents surged **700%**, Chinese nationals hired in Japanese IT increased **740%**, and bilateral AI cooperation agreements jumped **525%**. This repository documents a decade-long pattern of systematic technical integration through capital flows, talent mobility, patent collaboration, and policy convergence—tracked through **390 verified events** and **30+ institutional data sources**.

**Key Finding**: The 2024-2025 capital surge ($579.5B in tracked investments) followed a five-year technical integration period (2019-2023) where foundational dependencies were established through patents, talent, and infrastructure positioning.

## 🌸 Why "Chrysanthemum"?

The **chrysanthemum** is the Imperial Symbol of Japan, but it originated in China and became the "crown jewel" of Japanese culture. This flower symbolizes **longevity and endurance**—it's the only flower that blooms in the cold of late autumn.

Your research shows that even during the "geopolitical winter" of 2024-2025 (tariffs, tensions, strategic competition), the technical relationship between Japan and China continues to bloom. The name references Ruth Benedict's *The Chrysanthemum and the Sword*, one of the most influential studies of Japanese culture, nodding to the economic and cultural integration side while most analysis focuses on the military/"sword" dimension.

**The Pattern**: Something that started in one country (China's AI capabilities) becoming deeply integrated into another's infrastructure (Japan's technology base)—like the flower itself.

## 🔗 Related Research: Pattern Recognition Across Scales

This investigation documents foreign capital integration in allied technology infrastructure at the **national level** (Japan-China, 2015-2025). Similar patterns appear at **state level**:

- **[Arkansas Law Changes and AI Investment](https://github.com/Leerrooy95/Arkansas-Law-Changes-and-AI)**: Documents correlation between ballot initiative restrictions (Issue 1) and AI datacenter capital flows in Arkansas. Examines how infrastructure investment timing aligns with policy changes affecting democratic processes.

**Structural Similarities:**
- Capital positioning precedes policy shifts
- Infrastructure investments create dependency relationships
- Democratic oversight mechanisms weaken as capital concentration increases
- Timeline analysis reveals coordination patterns across nominally independent events

**Key Difference**: Arkansas analysis shows this pattern operating at state level within the United States. Japan analysis shows it operating at national level between allied democracies. The methodology is consistent; the scale varies.

### Background Research (Vendor-State Architecture)

This investigation builds on prior OSINT analysis documenting foreign capital dependencies in U.S. defense technology:

- **[Layers of Control: From AI to Ellison](https://github.com/Leerrooy95/Layers_of_Control-From_AI_to_Ellison)**: Maps Gulf sovereign wealth fund positioning in U.S. semiconductor and defense contractor supply chains (GlobalFoundries, Oracle, Palantir). Establishes methodological framework for tracking capital-policy-technology convergence patterns.

These earlier findings raised questions about broader patterns of foreign capital integration in allied technology infrastructures, leading to this Japan-focused investigation.
