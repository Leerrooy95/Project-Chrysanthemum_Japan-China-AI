## Entity Red Flags / Investigation Angles

### Multiple Vector Presence
Entities appearing across 2+ vectors suggest strategic coordination rather than organic market participation:
- **Huawei**: R&D (talent), Patents (technical), Policy (MoUs)
- **SoftBank**: Capital (Vision Fund), Policy (influence), Infrastructure (portfolio)
- **Alibaba**: Capital (FDI), Infrastructure (data centers), Talent (enterprise hiring)

### Timing Anomalies
Entities that accelerated during geopolitical tensions (2022-2025) rather than retreating:
- SoftBank maintained/increased China AI exposure
- Huawei expanded Japanese R&D despite Western restrictions
- Alibaba tripled capex amid tariff escalation

### Network Effects
Entities that appear frequently with other entities:
- SoftBank + ByteDance + SenseTime (Vision Fund portfolio cluster)
- Huawei + Japanese universities (partnership frequency)
- Alibaba + infrastructure providers (co-location patterns)

## For Journalists: Entity Contact/Verification

When investigating specific entities:

1. **Corporate Disclosures:** Check IR pages, annual reports, quarterly filings
2. **Government Filings:** METI company registrations, JETRO foreign entity records
3. **Patent Databases:** WIPO PATENTSCOPE for co-application patterns
4. **Policy Archives:** Diet Library for entity mentions in proceedings
5. **Academic Partnerships:** University MoU lists, research collaboration announcements

**Verification Protocol:**
- Cross-reference entity claims across 2+ primary sources
- Check timing against timeline dataset for context
- Confirm financial figures against corporate disclosures
- Verify personnel numbers through government labor surveys

---

## Related Research Entities (Context Only)

These entities appear in related background research but are not primary actors in Japan-China integration:

- **Larry Ellison / Oracle:** Vendor-state architecture (related repo)
- **Peter Thiel / Palantir:** Defense contractor dependencies (related repo)
- **Elon Musk:** Not direct actor in this analysis
- **AMD:** Historical context (GlobalFoundries divestiture)

These names are referenced for methodological consistency with prior research but are not central to Project Chrysanthemum findings.

## Entity Relationship Map (Conceptual)

```
Gulf Capital (PIF, Mubadala)
    ↓
SoftBank Vision Fund
    ↓
Chinese AI Companies (ByteDance, SenseTime)
    ↓
Technical Integration in Japan
    ↓
Infrastructure Dependencies (Huawei R&D, Alibaba Cloud)
    ↓
Policy Convergence (Diet cooperation > risk mentions)
```

This multi-hop structure creates plausible deniability while enabling capital flow and technical integration across geopolitical boundaries.
